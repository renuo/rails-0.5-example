= Rake Changelog

== Version 0.4.14

* Modified the TestTask to workaround the Ruby 1.8.2 change in
  autoexecuting unit tests.

== Version 0.4.13

* Fixed the dry-run flag so it is operating again.
* Multiple arguments to sh and ruby commands will not be interpreted
  by the shell (patch provided by Jonathan Paisley).

== Version 0.4.12

* Added --silent (-s) to suppress the (in directory) rake message.

== Version 0.4.11

* Changed the "don't know how to rake" message (finally)
* Changes references to a literal "Rakefile" to reference the global
  variable $rakefile (which contains the actual name of the rakefile).

== Version 0.4.10

* Added block support to the "sh" command, allowing users to take
  special actions on the result of the system call.  E.g.

    sh "shell_command" do |ok, res|
      puts "Program returned #{res.exitstatus}" if ! ok
    end

== Version 0.4.9

* Switched to Jamis Buck's RDoc template.
* Removed autorequire from Rake's gem spec.  This prevents the Rake
  libraries from loading while using rails.

== Version 0.4.8

* Added support for .rb versions of Rakefile.
* Removed \\\n's from test task.
* Fixed Ruby 1.9 compatibility issue with FileList.

== Version 0.4.7

* Fixed problem in FileList that caused Ruby 1.9 to go into infinite
  recursion.  Since to_a was removed from Object, it does not need to
  added back into the list of methods to rewrite in FileList.  (Thanks
  to Kent Sibilev for pointing this out).

== Version 0.4.6
* Removed test version of ln in FileUtils that prevented safe_ln from
  using ln.

== Version 0.4.5
* Upgraded comments in TestTask.
* FileList to_s and inspect now automatically resolve pending changes.
* FileList#exclude properly returns the FileList.

== Version 0.4.4
* Fixed initialization problem with @comment.
* Now using multi -r technique in TestTask.  Switch Rakefile back to
  using the built-in test task macros because the rake runtime is no
  longer needed.
* Added 'TEST=filename' and 'TESTOPTS=options' to the Test Task
  macros.
* Allow a +test_files+ attribute in test tasks.  This allows more
  flexibility in specifying test files.

== Version 0.4.3
* Fixed Comment leakage.

== Version 0.4.2
* Added safe_ln that falls back to a copy if a file link is not supported.
* Package builder now uses safe_ln.

== Version 0.4.1
* Task comments are now additive, combined with "/".
* Works with (soon to be released) rubygems 0.6.2 (or 0.7.0)

== Version 0.4.0
* FileList now uses deferred loading.  The file system is not searched
  until the first call that needs the file names.
* VAR=VALUE options are now accepted on the command line and are
  treated like environment variables.  The values may be tested in a
  Rakefile by referencing ENV['VAR'].
* File.mtime is now used (instead of File.new().mtime).

== Version 0.3.2.x

* Removed some hidden dependencies on rubygems.  Tests now will test
  gems only if they are installed.
* Removed Sys from some example files.  I believe that is that last
  reference to Sys outside of the contrib area.
* Updated all copyright notices to include 2004.

== Version 0.3.2

* GEM Installation now works with the application stub.
